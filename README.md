# Encryption Project

## Project Overview

This Java-based project provides a simple application for encrypting and decrypting names stored in a text file. Users can choose between different encryption methods to securely transform their data. The encrypted data can then be stored back in the text file, maintaining the original format. The project demonstrates basic file I/O operations, string manipulation, and simple encryption techniques in Java.

## Features

- Read names from a text file, where names are stored as comma-separated values.
- Encrypt names using one of four encryption methods:
  1. **Hash Code**: Each name's hash code.
  2. **ASCII Multiplication**: ASCII value of each character multiplied by the number of names.
  3. **Hash Code with Count**: Each name's hash code added to the total number of names.
  4. **Hash Code with Random Number**: Each name's hash code added to a random number.
- Store the encrypted names back into the text file.
- Decrypt the encrypted names and restore them to their original form.


### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- A text editor or an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
